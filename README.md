# Prodigy Info Tech - 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

As part of my **Virtual Machine Learning Internship**, I successfully completed a project on **House Price Prediction** using **Linear Regression**.
The objective of this task was to develop a **simple and interactive web application** using **Flask** that predicts house prices based on user-provided inputs. 

The backend model was trained on the well-known **Ames Housing Dataset**, utilizing core features that influence residential property prices. The trained model was serialized using **Joblib**, and the application was built with **Python, Flask, and HTML/CSS.**

## This project strengthened my skills in:
- Data preprocessing and model training using Scikit-learn
- Building web applications with Flask
- Deploying ML models into real-time environments
- Creating clean and responsive user interfaces using HTML/CSS

## 📌 Features
- Predicts house prices using:
  - Ground Living Area (sq ft)
  - Number of Bedrooms above Ground
  - Number of Full Bathrooms
- Clean, responsive frontend with HTML/CSS
- Model trained using Scikit-learn and deployed using Flask
- Prediction results are displayed on a dynamic result page


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- HTML, CSS
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Joblib (for model serialization)

## 🧠 Model Training
The training script app.py loads the dataset, trains a Linear Regression model using:
- GrLivArea (Ground Living Area)
- BedroomAbvGr (Bedrooms Above Ground)
- FullBath (Full Bathrooms)

## ✅ Results
- Successfully trained a Linear Regression model
- Saved the trained model in .pkl format using Joblib for efficient reuse and deployment.

**Developed a Python Flask web application that:**
- Accepts user inputs via a web form
- Uses the trained model to predict house prices dynamically
- Displays results on a clean, responsive result page

**Ensured end-to-end functionality from model training to real-time web-based prediction**
